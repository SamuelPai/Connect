# Reunion

Planning a trip with your friends or family can be both exciting and stressful at the same time. It can be stressful because as the number of trip attendees increases, the more chaos and disorganization there is due to the fact that everyone is inputting various information (such as activities to do, places to go, etc..) all in one chat group. In order to solve this problem, me and my team created this app to solve that problem by combining all those trip planning aspects in one organized and easy to use platform, thus reducing stress and disorganization.
## Getting Started

To deploy this app locally, you must have two terminal tabs open. On the first tab, run the command "npm run start:dev:react" and on the second tab, run the command "npm run start:dev:node". This will start up both the front end and back end of this application. 
### Prerequisites

You must have node, npm, and mysql installed as prerequisites. The app will start by running the start scrips mentioned below. 
```
npm run start:dev:react
npm run start:dev:node
```

## Deployment

In the process of being deployed on Heroku

## How to Use the App
Upon reaching the landing page of our application, you must click log in in order to authenticate and authorize before moving onto the "trips" page. Once logged in, click on the trips page to see the list of trips you are apart of. These will be populated on the left. If you click on each individual trip, more information about that trip will populate on the right side, along with activities associated with that trip on the bottom. You have to option to add both a trip and an activity.
